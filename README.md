To test typed/untyped interaction:

```
$ racket main.rkt <BIN-DIR>
```

This compiles and runs a few small programs using the `raco` and `racket`
 executables from `<BIN-DIR>`.

Alternatively, just run the Makefile to test using the directory that holds
 the `racket` executable:

```
$ make
```

Should finish within 5 minutes.
